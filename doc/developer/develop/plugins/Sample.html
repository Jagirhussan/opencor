        <p>
            The purpose of this plugin is to give other plugins access to a simple <code>add</code> function, which could be used as follows:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">#include "sampleutils.h"

...

double addResult = Sample::add(3.0, 5.0);

...</pre>

        <p>
            In order to create such a plugin, we first need to decide on its category. Currently supported categories are <code>Analysis</code>, <code>Api</code>, <code>Editing</code>, <code>Miscellaneous</code>, <code>Organisation</code>, <code>Sample</code>, <code>Simulation</code>, <code>Support</code>, <code>ThirdParty</code> and <code>Widget</code> (see the <code>Category</code> enum in the <code>PluginInfo</code> class in <a href="https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/src/plugins/plugininfo.h"><code>[OpenCOR]/src/plugins/plugininfo.h</code></a>). For our current plugin, we will be using the <code>Sample</code> category.
        </p>

        <p>
            The category of a plugin is not only needed by OpenCOR (to improve user experience), but also to determine the location of a plugin's code. Indeed, the code of all our plugins is located under <a href="https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/src/plugins/"><code>[OpenCOR]/src/plugins/</code></a> and, more precisely, under a category folder. Thus, the code of our <code>Sample</code> plugins is to be located under the <code>sample</code> folder (see <a href="https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/src/plugins/sample/"><code>[OpenCOR]/src/plugins/sample/</code></a>). However, we need to be able to distinguish between the code of our various <code>Sample</code> plugins. We therefore need to create a folder for our plugin and its name is to be that of our plugin, i.e. <code>Sample</code>. So, in the end, the code of our <code>Sample</code> plugin is to be located under <a href="https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/src/plugins/sample/Sample/"><code>[OpenCOR]/src/plugins/sample/Sample/</code></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, OpenCOR is built using <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>, so to be able to build our plugin, we need to have a simple CMake project for it. This is done by creating a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file (see <a href="https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/src/plugins/sample/Sample/CMakeLists.txt"><code>[OpenCOR]/src/plugins/sample/Sample/CMakeLists.txt</code></a>), which contents is as follows:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">PROJECT(SamplePlugin)

# Add the plugin

ADD_PLUGIN(Sample
    SOURCES
        ../../plugininfo.cpp

        src/sampleplugin.cpp
        src/sampleutils.cpp
    INCLUDE_DIRS
        src
    QT_MODULES
        Core
    QT_LIBRARIES
        QtCore
)</pre>

        <p>
            The first line specifies the name of the CMake project for our <code>Sample</code> plugin, which here is <code>SamplePlugin</code>. Next, we have a call to the <code>ADD_PLUGIN</code> macro. This macro effectively handles the building of our pugin, this using the information that is passed to it. That information comes in the form of a series of parameters, some of which are keywords (<code>SOURCES</code>, <code>INCLUDE_DIRS</code>, <code>QT_MODULES</code> and <code>QT_LIBRARIES</code> at lines 6, 11, 13 and 15) that are used to give a specific meaning to the parameters that follow them. (The meaning of those keywords and that of others can be found <a href="index.html#ADD_PLUGIN%20macro">here</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            As for any plugin, our <code>Sample</code> plugin must reference <a href="https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/src/plugins/plugininfo.cpp"><code>plugininfo.cpp</code></a> (line 7), so that it can provide some <a href="index.html#Basic%20information">basic information</a> about itself (more on this below). The <code>.cpp</code> files that contain the plugin's code clearly need to be referenced too (lines 9 and 10). Note that they start with <code>sample</code>, i.e. the name of the plugin. This is a convention that is used throughout OpenCOR's code to ensure that there is no name clashing. To make <code>#include</code> statements simpler to write (and to maintain), we provide <code>src</code> as an include directory (line 12). Finally, and though our <code>Sample</code> plugin is very minimal, OpenCOR uses the <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a> framework. So, we need to reference both the <code>Core</code> module and the <code>QtCore</code> library (lines 14 and 16, respectively).

        <p>
            The following limitations have been observed while using OpenCOR on our <a href="supportedPlatforms.html">supported platforms</a>. They may apply to you, or not, depending on the platform you use and your specific circumstances.
        </p>

        <div class="section">
            Windows, Linux and OS X
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>By default, OpenCOR uses your system's language for menus, dialog boxes, etc., as long as it is either English or French (please <a href="contactUs.html">contact us</a> if you would like OpenCOR to support other languages). If your system uses another language, then OpenCOR will default to English. Otherwise, if you specifically specify English or French, then please be aware that system messages, dialog boxes, etc. will still be displayed using your system's language (assuming it is not one of the languages supported by OpenCOR).</li>
            <li>OpenCOR uses the <a href="http://cellml-api.sourceforge.net/">CellML API</a>, which will crash OpenCOR if you try to export a CellML file to a user-defined format that is described in a file that contains valid, but unknown, XML.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            Windows
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>OpenCOR's <a href="plugins/FileBrowser.html">FileBrowser plugin</a> may, on some systems, result in OpenCOR being slow to respond at startup. This has nothing to do with OpenCOR, but with Windows or, rather, a program that tightly integrates with the Windows shell. There are <a href="http://www.brighthub.com/computing/windows-platform/articles/86552.aspx">several known causes and solutions</a> to this problem. However, should none of them work for you, then you might have to unselect the FileBrowser plugin.</li>
        </ul>

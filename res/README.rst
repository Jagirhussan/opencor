Some information on the OpenCOR logo: \*
`OpenCOR.svg <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.svg>`__:
this was created from the original VPH logo, saving the resulting SVG
file as an optimised SVG file (using
`Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`__), and beautifying it using
http://xmlbeautifier.com/. \*
`splashscreen.png <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/splashscreen.png>`__
(as well as
`[OpenCOR]/src/plugins/miscellaneous/Core/res/logo.png <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/src/plugins/miscellaneous/Core/res/logo.png>`__,
although its size was reduced to 35%): this was created by opening
`OpenCOR.svg <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.svg>`__
in `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`__, reducing its size to 50%,
making a screenshot, extracting the part that is inside the box, and
making its background transparent (using
`GIMP <https://www.gimp.org/>`__). \*
`OpenCOR.pptx <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.pptx>`__:
this was created by using a screenshot version of
`OpenCOR.svg <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.svg>`__,
adding some space around it (e.g. 50 pixels), and making sure that it is
square, \*
OpenCOR[\ `.ico <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.ico>`__\ \|\ `.png <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.png>`__\ \|\ `.icns <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.icns>`__]:
these were created by saving a 100% version of
`OpenCOR.pptx <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.pptx>`__
as a PNG file, using that PNG file as an input to
http://iconverticons.com/online/, and downloading the corresponding
``.ico``, ``.png`` (the 256x256 pixel version) and ``.icns`` versions.

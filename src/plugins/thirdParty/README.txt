Third-party plugins can take time to build (especially LLVM). So, since we (should) never modify them, there is no point in wasting time building them every time we build OpenCOR from scratch. So, unless we explicitly want to build one or all of them (by setting USE_PREBUILT_LLVM_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_QSCINTILLA_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_QWT_PLUGIN and/or USE_PREBUILT_SUNDIALS_PLUGIN to OFF in the main CMakeLists.txt file), then we retrieve the pre-built version of the third-party plugins off the OpenCOR website.

Note that to build a third-party plugin on OS X will, by default, produce a 'dirty' binary (it is so that it can work without any problem with XCode). Yet, we need a 'clean' binary, so we must build the third-party plugin as if we wanted to package OpenCOR.

Third-party plugins can take time to build (especially LLVM). So, since we (should) never modify them, there is no point in wasting time building them every time we build OpenCOR from scratch. So, unless we explicitly want to build one or all of them (by setting USE_PREBUILT_LLVM_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_QSCINTILLA_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_QWT_PLUGIN and/or USE_PREBUILT_SUNDIALS_PLUGIN to OFF in [OpenCOR]/cmake/common.cmake), then we retrieve the pre-built version of the third-party plugins off the OpenCOR website.

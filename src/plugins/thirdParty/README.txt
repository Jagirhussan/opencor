Third-party plugins can take time to build (especially LLVM). So, since we (should) never modify them, there is no point in wasting time building them every time we build OpenCOR from scratch. So, unless we explicitly want to build one or all of them (by setting the USE_PREBUILT_LLVM_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_QSCINTILLA_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_QWT_PLUGIN and/or USE_PREBUILT_SUNDIALS_PLUGIN option/s to OFF), then we retrieve the pre-built version of the third-party plugins off the OpenCOR website.

Note that building a third-party plugin on OS X does, by default, produce a 'dirty' binary (it is so that it can work with XCode). Now, this is fine if we are only to use that binary locally. However, if the binary is to become the new pre-built version of one of our third-party plugins, then we need it to be 'clean'. This means that it must be built as if we wanted to package OpenCOR.

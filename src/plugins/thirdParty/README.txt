Third-party plugins can take time to build (especially LLVM). So, since we (should) never modify them, there is no point in wasting time building them every time we build OpenCOR from scratch. So, unless we explicitly want to build one or all of them (by setting the USE_PREBUILT_LIBGIT2_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_LLVM_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_OAUTH_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_QSCINTILLA_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_QWT_PLUGIN, USE_PREBUILT_SUNDIALS_PLUGIN and/or USE_PREBUILT_ZLIB_PLUGIN option/s to OFF), then we retrieve the pre-built version of the third-party plugins off the OpenCOR website.

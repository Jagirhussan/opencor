We need to build `LLVM <http://www.llvm.org/>`__ (incl. `Clang <http://clang.llvm.org/>`__) ourselves so that it can be used as a 'proper' plugin within OpenCOR. The problem with the latter is that it's not possible to build `LLVM <http://www.llvm.org/>`__ as a shared library using MSVC (because of the need to expose classes/methods as ``__declspec(dllexport)`` or ``__declspec(dllimport)`` depending on whether `LLVM <http://www.llvm.org/>`__ is being built or referenced, respectively).

Some `third-party plugins <https://github.com/opencor/opencor/tree/master/src/plugins/thirdParty>`__ can take time to build, be it directly or indirectly. In the former case, the third-party library is built and embedded in the plugin (e.g. `LLVM <http://www.llvm.org/>`__) while in the latter case, the third-party library is built as a package and the plugin links to it (e.g. `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`__).

In both cases, there should never be a need to modify those third-party libraries. Therefore, there is no point in wasting time building them every time we build OpenCOR from scratch.

So, unless we explicitly want to build one or all of them (except `Zinc <https://github.com/OpenCMISS/zinc>`__; by setting the ``USE_PREBUILT_LIBGIT2_PACKAGE``, ``USE_PREBUILT_LLVM_PLUGIN``, ``USE_PREBUILT_OPENSSL_PACKAGE``, ``USE_PREBUILT_QSCINTILLA_PACKAGE``, ``USE_PREBUILT_QWT_PLUGIN``, ``USE_PREBUILT_SUNDIALS_PACKAGE`` and/or ``USE_PREBUILT_ZLIB_PACKAGE`` option/s to ``OFF``), we retrieve their pre-built version off the `OpenCOR website <http://www.opencor.ws/>`__ (for direct plugins) or `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ (for indirect plugins).

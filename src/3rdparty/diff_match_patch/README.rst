The original `diff-match-patch <https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/>`_ code used to be hosted on `Google Code <https://code.google.com/>`_, but that site has since been shut down. A copy can still be found on the `author's website <https://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/svn/trunk/cpp/>`_, but we still went for an `STL version <https://github.com/leutloff/diff-match-patch-cpp-stl>`_ of that code instead. Indeed, not only is that `STL version <https://github.com/leutloff/diff-match-patch-cpp-stl>`_ maintained, but it is also supposed to be faster and it comes as a header file only, which makes it easier for us to use throughout OpenCOR (since it does not require creating a special plugin for it).
